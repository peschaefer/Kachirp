Kachirp

Kachirp is a trivia game that pulls data from https://trivia.willfry.co.uk

To run this program, run the main method and choose which option you would like to pursue. Once a game mode is chosen (option 1 or 3), you can choose how many questions you would like to be asked. To upload your own question banks, select option 2 and follow the instructions. Your bank is saved in the "QuestionBanks" source directory.

Warnings:

When running tests individually, some print the following in the console:
org.junit.platform.launcher.core.EngineDiscoveryOrchestrator lambda$logTestDescriptorExclusionReasons$7
INFO: 0 containers and 7 tests were Method or class mismatch

This has no impact on the test results and can be disregarded.
