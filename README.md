Kachirp

Kachirp is a jokingly passive agressive trivia game that pulls data from https://trivia.willfry.co.uk

To run this program, run the main method and choose which option you would like to pursue. The two gamemodes include vanilla and custom. The vanilla game pulls from the API meniton above and allows the user to specify number of questions as well as categories.  The custom game pulls data from the QuestionBanks directory.  To upload your own question banks, select option 3 and follow the instructions.  This bank is saved as a JSON file in the QuestionBanks directory

Warnings:

When running tests individually, some print the following in the console:
org.junit.platform.launcher.core.EngineDiscoveryOrchestrator lambda$logTestDescriptorExclusionReasons$7
INFO: 0 containers and 7 tests were Method or class mismatch

This has no impact on the test results and can be disregarded.
